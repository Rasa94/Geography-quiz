# Geography quiz
(JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, Firebase, Bootstrap 4)

This is the geography [quiz web app](http://zanimljiva-geografija-003.projekti.itbootcamp.rs/). The goal of the game is to guess a term based on a randomly generated letter for each of the seven categories.
The points are given to the player only if the used terms are in the database.

## Functionalities:
- Adding new terms to the database
- Player vs. pc
- Player vs. player
- High score list
- Hall of fame list(shows which users added the most terms)

High score and hall of fame are curently disabled because of Firebase quotas and limits.

Make sure Node.js is installed.

## Install dependencies:
